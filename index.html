    <h1>Inheritance and Prototype</h1>
    <hr>
    <div>
        Q1.Create 2 objects - parent and child. Attach methods to parent and use those methods in child
        object
        using parents prototype
    </div>
    <div>
        <pre>
            const parent ={
                firstname : "Altamash",
                lastname : "Sayyed",
                fullname : function title(){
                    console.log(this.firstname+" "+this.lastname);
                }
            }
            
            const child ={
                _proto_: parent
            }
            child.fullname();
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div>
        Explanation → First an object was created and two keys were passed as firstname and lastname
        with their respected values. After that the function was called to store the parent value. And at last with the
        help of _proto_ keyword the parent was targeted. and consoled at last.
    </div>

    <div>
        Q2.Write code to explain prototype chaining
    </div>
    <div>
        <pre>
        let obj={
            name : "Adnan"
        }
        
        let obj1 ={
            _proto_: obj,
            lastname : "Chaudhary"
        }
        
        let obj2 = {
            _proto_: obj1,
            age :   "20",
        }
        
        console.log(obj.name);
        
    </pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        Explanation → Here three objects were made by using object literal method, and
        chaining was made by using proto keyword, and last obj was called which was obtained through chaining.
    </div>

    <div>
        Q3.Add a method to calculate sum of all elements in Array in array's protype, use that method to
        calculate sum for multiple arrays
    </div>
    <div>
        <pre>
        Array.prototype.sum = function() {
            let result = 0;
            for (let i = 0; i &lt; this.length; i++) {
              result += this[i];
            }
            return result;
          };
        
        let N1 = [6, 8, 9];
        let N2 = [7, 8, 6];
        
        
        let addition = N1.sum() + N2.sum()
        console.log(addition);
        
    </pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        Explanation → Array.prototype targets the parent element where we have assigned the sum function
        and
        stored it as a object, where we have made a for loop to intiate a sum function. Later on we the help of array
        we stored values to be summed and the result is stored in the addition variable,where the output is consoled
        with the addition variable.
    </div>

    <div>
        Q4.Write a JavaScript function to retrieve all the names of object's own and inherited
        properties.
    </div>
    <div>
        <pre>
        class student {
            constructor(name, rollno, division){
                this.name= name;
                this.rollno= rollno;
                this.division = division; 
            }
        
            set setFriend(friend){
                this.friend= friend
            }
        }
        
        let obj = new student("Adnan", "690","A")
        obj.friend="Hasan"
        console.log(obj);
        
        class senior extends student{
             constructor(){
                super("Shekhar", "999", "F")
             }
        }
         let seniorObject = new senior();
         console.log(seniorObject)
    </pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        Explanation → At first we created a class using object constructor function and respected
        parameters were passed and After that it was consoled, to retrieve the other name a new class was created
        with the help of extends keyword, and now to retrieve or recaccess the first constructor, the super function
        was used.
